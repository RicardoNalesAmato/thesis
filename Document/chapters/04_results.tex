\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chapter:Evaluation}

In this chapter we will first show what our methodology for experimentation was, the reasoning behind each experiment, their value and contribution towards this thesis's goal, and how we went about doing each one. Secondly, we will show, and analyze all the results of said experiments.
