Software projects are big understatements, usually developed by several teams. All of them will be supporting the same codebase, which will grow exponentially week by week, and surely gathering a good amount of bugs along the way.
For this matter, testing has been widely adopted to find bugs and resolve them. But the question that arises when a bug is found more times than not is: how do we know which bug(s) we should prioritize? how can we measure the impact of a given bug? how many resources are required to solve this bug?

In this Master Thesis we set out to find if there was a correlation between the graph features of a program's callgraph, and its vulnerabilities found through a compositional symbolic execution, using MACKE. The graph features are to be generated by an internally developed tool, which in turn would allow us to automate the process of assessing the vulnerability.

We then follow to test our automatic assessment model with real professional feedback by using a GUI with which users can interact and see the results for themselves.
