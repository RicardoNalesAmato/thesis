  "autoTrace": "A program for converting bitmap to vector graphics.The aim of the AutoTrace project is the development of a freely available application with a functionality similar to CorelTrace or Adobe Streamline. I hope that it will become better than all commercially available programs. In some aspects it is already better. AutoTrace is free software. AutoTrace is distributed under the term of GNU GPL.",
  "blueZ": "BlueZ provides support for the core Bluetooth layers and protocols. It is flexible, efficient and uses a modular implementation.",
  "graphicsMagic": "GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing. Comprised of 267K physical lines (according to David A. Wheeler's SLOCCount) of source code in the base package (or 1,225K including 3rd party libraries) it provides a robust and efficient collection of tools and libraries which support reading, writing, and manipulating an image in over 88 major formats including important formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF.",
  "icoutils": "The icoutils are a set of command-line programs for extracting and converting images in Microsoft Windows(R) icon and cursor files. These files usually have the extension .ico or .cur, but they can also be embedded in executables and libraries (.dll-files).",
  "imageMagic": "It can read and write images in a variety of formats (over 200) including PNG, JPEG, JPEG-2000, GIF, TIFF, DPX, EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG. Use ImageMagick to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and BÃ©zier curves.",
  "jasper": "JasPer - a project to create a reference implementation of the codec specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e. ISO/IEC 15444-1) - started in 1997 at Image Power Inc. and at the University of British Columbia. It consists of a C library and some sample applications useful for testing the codec.",
  "jasper2": "JasPer - a project to create a reference implementation of the codec specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e. ISO/IEC 15444-1) - started in 1997 at Image Power Inc. and at the University of British Columbia. It consists of a C library and some sample applications useful for testing the codec.",
  "libarchive": "The libarchive project develops a portable, efficient C library that can read and write streaming archives in a variety of formats. It also includes implementations of the common tar, cpio, and zcat command-line tools that use the libarchive library.",
  "libass": "libass is a portable subtitle renderer for the ASS/SSA (Advanced Substation Alpha/Substation Alpha) subtitle format. It is mostly compatible with VSFilter.",
  "libmad": "libmad is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder capable of 24-bit output.",
  "libplist": "A small portable C library to handle Apple Property List files in binary or XML.",
  "libsndfile": "Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound (such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one standard library interface. It is released in source code format under the Gnu Lesser General Public License.",
  "libxml2": "Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project (but usable outside of the Gnome platform), it is free software available under the MIT License. XML itself is a metalanguage to design markup languages, i.e. text language where semantic and structure are added to the content using extra \"markup\" information enclosed between angle brackets. HTML is the most well-known markup language. Though the library is written in C a variety of language bindings make it available in other environments.",
  "lrzip": "A compression utility that excels at compressing large files (usually > 10-50 MB). Larger files and/or more free RAM means that the utility will be able to more effectively compress your files (ie: faster / smaller size), especially if the filesize(s) exceed 100 MB. You can either choose to optimise for speed (fast compression / decompression) or size, but not both.",
  "openslp": "Service Location Protocol (SLP) is an Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards track protocol that provides a framework to allow networking applications to discover the existence, location, and configuration of networked services in enterprise networks.",
  "potrace": "Potrace(TM) is a tool for tracing a bitmap, which means, transforming a bitmap into a smooth, scalable image. The input is a bitmap (PBM, PGM, PPM, or BMP format), and the output is one of several vector file formats. A typical use is to create SVG or PDF files from scanned data, such as company or university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image is not \"jaggy\" like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.",
  "rzip": "rzip is a compression program, similar in functionality to gzip or bzip2, but able to take advantage long distance redundencies in files, which can sometimes allow rzip to produce much better compression ratios than other programs. ",
  "tcpdump": "Tcpdump prints out a description of the contents of packets on a network interface that match the boolean expression; the description is preceded by a time stamp, printed, by default, as hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second since midnight. It can also be run with the -w flag, which causes it to save the packet data to a file for later analysis, and/or with the -r flag, which causes it to read from a saved packet file rather than to read packets from a network interface. It can also be run with the -V flag, which causes it to read a list of saved packet files. In all cases, only packets that match expression will be processed by tcpdump.",
  "tifDirread": "This software provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a widely used format for storing image data. ",
  "virglrenderer": "Virgil is a research project to investigate the possibility of creating a virtual 3D GPU for use inside qemu virtual machines, that allows the guest operating system to use the capabilities of the host GPU to accelerate 3D rendering. The plan is to have a guest GPU that is fully independent of the host GPU.",
  "ytnef": "ytnefprocess can be used as a filter with procmail to automatically extract the files contained in the ms-tnef attachment and recreate a new mail with them attached instead."
